# Backstage OS - Theater Management Platform

## Overview

Backstage OS is a modern web application designed for theater professionals to manage projects, teams, and reports. The platform supports two user types: freelance theater professionals and full-time theater employees, each with tailored workflows. Built as a full-stack application using React, Express, and PostgreSQL, it provides comprehensive stage management capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express session with PostgreSQL store

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon serverless connection pooling

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth using OpenID Connect
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions table
- **User Profiles**: Support for freelance vs full-time user types
- **Middleware**: Custom authentication middleware for protected routes

### Project Management
- **Projects Table**: Core entity for tracking shows/projects
- **Status Tracking**: Multi-stage project lifecycle (planning → performance → closed)
- **User-specific Views**: Different terminology and workflows for freelance vs full-time users
- **Team Integration**: Project ownership and team member association

### Database Schema
Key tables include:
- `users`: User profiles with authentication data
- `projects`: Core project/show information
- `sessions`: Session management for Replit Auth
- Additional tables for team members and reports (referenced but not fully implemented)

### UI Component System
- **Design System**: Shadcn/UI with "new-york" style variant
- **Theme Support**: CSS custom properties for light/dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Radix UI primitives ensure ARIA compliance

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses application
2. Unauthenticated users see landing page
3. Replit Auth handles OAuth flow
4. User data synced to local database
5. Profile type selection (freelance/fulltime) on first login
6. Authenticated users access main application

### Project Management Flow
1. Users create projects with basic information
2. Projects support status progression through theater production phases
3. Team members can be invited to projects
4. Reports can be generated for projects
5. Data is persisted through Drizzle ORM to PostgreSQL

### API Architecture
- RESTful API design with Express.js
- Authentication middleware protects all API routes
- Consistent error handling and logging
- JSON request/response format

## External Dependencies

### Authentication
- **Replit Auth**: Primary authentication provider
- **OpenID Connect**: Standard OAuth 2.0 implementation
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed session store

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- **Connection Management**: WebSocket-based connections for serverless environment

### UI Dependencies
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with Vite dev server
- **Production**: Node.js server serving built assets
- **Database**: Environment-based DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Sessions**: Secure session management with environment-specific secrets

### Build Process
1. Frontend assets built with Vite
2. Backend bundled with esbuild
3. Static assets served from Express
4. Database migrations applied via Drizzle Kit

### Hosting
- **Platform**: Designed for Replit deployment
- **Autoscale**: Configured for Replit's autoscale deployment target
- **Asset Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets in production

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session signing secret
- `REPL_ID`: Replit environment identifier
- `ISSUER_URL`: OAuth issuer URL (defaults to Replit)
